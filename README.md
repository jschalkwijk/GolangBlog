# GolangBlog
I'm trying to build a simple blog in Go (golang) to practice the languagel.

For now, you can add/edit, posts/categories. I use MySQL as my Database and run it with Mamp or Wamp.
You can insert your own host/user/password adn port in the config file.

Most work is done in the back-end for now, the fornt-end

What you can currently do:

Create Posts
Create Categories
Upload Files, and create folders
Create Users

Remove to trash, delete, edit users and posts

Download this repo, run the sql, login with username: admin, password: root.
Ofocurse you can change this immediately when running on a live server.
